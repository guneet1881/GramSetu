# Requirements Document: GramSetu
## Sovereign Agentic Infrastructure for Last-Mile Public Service Delivery

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Executive Vision

GramSetu (Village Bridge) represents a paradigmatic shift from **Informational AI to Agentic AI** in India's digital governance landscape. While existing solutions like Jugalbandi excel at retrieving information, they fail to address the critical **Action Gap** - the inability to perform complex, multi-step actions required to actually apply for government schemes.

GramSetu is an **autonomous, voice-first, multimodal agentic infrastructure** capable of navigating legacy government websites exactly as a human would - seeing the screen, clicking buttons, typing text - driven entirely by vernacular voice commands. This system empowers Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) at Common Service Centres (CSCs) to process complex applications in seconds rather than minutes, fundamentally altering the economics of rural service delivery.

### 1.2 The "Insane" Proposition

We propose an autonomous system that:
- Navigates legacy portals using **visual web navigation** (multimodal LLMs analyzing screenshots)
- Operates through **vernacular voice commands** in 11+ Indian languages
- Performs **privacy-preserving OCR** with automatic Aadhaar masking at the edge
- Maintains **sovereign AI infrastructure** using Bhashini and AWS Bedrock
- Achieves **10x VLE productivity** increase (₹60/hour → ₹600/hour)
- Operates **offline-first** with intelligent sync and state recovery

### 1.3 Problem Statement: The Action Gap

**Current State:**
- 900 million rural Indians lack access to digital services despite infrastructure availability
- Existing AI chatbots inform citizens of eligibility but cannot complete applications
- Government portals feature hostile UX: aggressive timeouts, English/Sarkari Hindi, complex workflows
- VLEs spend 20 minutes per application due to repetitive form-filling
- Low throughput (3 applications/hour) forces VLEs to charge illicit fees

**The Root Cause:**
The "Read-Only Trap" - Government portals are effectively read-only for target demographics due to:
- Linguistic exclusion (Sanskritized administrative Hindi vs. regional dialects)
- Hostile UX patterns (session timeouts, non-responsive layouts)
- Cognitive overload (15-20 field mapping from physical documents)
- Traditional RPA brittleness (fixed selectors break when DOM changes)

**GramSetu's Solution:**
Transform "read-only" portals into "read-write" APIs through autonomous agents that:
- Navigate visually (immune to DOM changes)
- Understand vernacular voice commands
- Recover from failures intelligently
- Maintain human oversight for accountability

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

**Primary Goals:**
1. Enable **autonomous portal navigation** with VLE supervision for critical checkpoints
2. Achieve **10x VLE productivity** increase (3 apps/hour → 30 apps/hour)
3. Support **11+ Indian languages** through Bhashini integration with dialect mapping
4. Implement **privacy-by-design** with edge-based Aadhaar masking
5. Operate **offline-tolerant** with intelligent job queuing and sync
6. Provide **WhatsApp-based citizen notifications** for transparency
7. Maintain **DPDP Act 2023 compliance** with consent capture and audit trails
8. Support **20+ high-impact government schemes** at launch

**Performance Goals:**
- Voice-to-intent latency: < 3 seconds
- Application completion time: 2 minutes (vs. 20 minutes manual)
- Intent recognition accuracy: > 90%

- Transaction fee: ₹2 per successful application (10% of VLE earnings)
- Freemium model: First 100 transactions free

### 2.2 Non-Goals

1. **NOT** a direct citizen-facing app (VLEs remain essential intermediaries)
2. **NOT** bypassing security measures (CAPTCHA/OTP require VLE intervention)
3. **NOT** storing Aadhaar numbers permanently
4. **NOT** modifying government portal functionality
5. **NOT** 100% autonomous (human-in-the-loop for critical decisions)

| Data deletion compliance | 100% (within 90 days) |
| Security audit pass rate | 100% (annual CERT-In audits) |

## 10. Constraints and Assumptions

### 10.1 Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**
- GramSetu must operate within existing CSC infrastructure (no specialized hardware)
- The system cannot modify government portal code or bypass security (CAPTCHA/OTP)
- Bhashini API availability and performance limits multilingual capabilities
- Rural internet connectivity: intermittent 2G/3G with bandwidth < 1 Mbps
- Mobile devices: entry-level Android (4GB RAM, limited storage)

**Regulatory Constraints:**
- DPDP Act 2023 compliance mandatory (consent, minimization, localization)
- UIDAI regulations prohibit permanent Aadhaar storage
- CERT-In guidelines require incident reporting within 6 hours
- IT Act 2000 liability for data breaches

**Operational Constraints:**
- VLEs have varying technical literacy (interface must be intuitive)
- Budget limits initial scheme coverage to 20 high-priority schemes
- CSCs have basic IT support (system must be self-healing)
- Government portals change without notice (visual navigation mitigates)

### 10.2 Assumptions

**Infrastructure Assumptions:**
- VLEs have access to smartphones with camera and microphone
- CSCs have basic internet connectivity (even if intermittent)
- AWS infrastructure remains available and performant
- Bhashini services continue to improve and remain free/affordable

**User Assumptions:**
- Citizens provide informed consent for data processing
- VLEs receive 2-day training on GramSetu before deployment
- CSCs have basic troubleshooting capabilities (restart app, check network)
- VLEs are motivated by 10x income increase to adopt new system

**Regulatory Assumptions:**
- Government portals remain accessible (not blocked for automation)
- DPDP Act enforcement allows legitimate service delivery use cases
- Scheme eligibility rules are publicly documented and accessible
- Portal authentication mechanisms (OTP) remain human-verifiable

## 11. Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded)

1. **Direct citizen self-service app**: GramSetu serves VLEs, not citizens directly
2. **CAPTCHA/OTP bypass**: These require human intervention by design
3. **Payment processing**: Integration with payment gateways deferred to Phase 2
4. **Biometric authentication**: Aadhaar e-KYC integration deferred to Phase 2
5. **Voice biometrics**: "Voice as password" deferred to Q3 2024
6. **Offline voice recognition**: Requires cloud Bhashini APIs
7. **Support for all 700+ government schemes**: Phased rollout starting with top 20
8. **Multi-tenancy for non-CSC operators**: Initial focus on CSC ecosystem only
9. **Mobile app for tier-1 city citizens**: Product market fit is rural India

# Requirements Document: GramSetu
## Sovereign Agentic Infrastructure for Last-Mile Public Service Delivery

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Executive Vision

GramSetu (Village Bridge) represents a paradigmatic shift from **Informational AI to Agentic AI** in India's digital governance landscape. While existing solutions like Jugalbandi excel at retrieving information, they fail to address the critical **Action Gap** - the inability to perform complex, multi-step actions required to actually apply for government schemes.

GramSetu is an **autonomous, voice-first, multimodal agentic infrastructure** capable of navigating legacy government websites exactly as a human would - seeing the screen, clicking buttons, typing text - driven entirely by vernacular voice commands. This system empowers Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) at Common Service Centres (CSCs) to process complex applications in seconds rather than minutes, fundamentally altering the economics of rural service delivery.

### 1.2 The "Insane" Proposition

We propose an autonomous system that:
- Navigates legacy portals using **visual web navigation** (multimodal LLMs analyzing screenshots)
- Operates through **vernacular voice commands** in 11+ Indian languages
- Performs **privacy-preserving OCR** with automatic Aadhaar masking at the edge
- Maintains **sovereign AI infrastructure** using Bhashini and AWS Bedrock
- Achieves **10x VLE productivity** increase (₹60/hour → ₹600/hour)
- Operates **offline-first** with intelligent sync and state recovery

### 1.3 Problem Statement: The Action Gap

**Current State:**
- 900 million rural Indians lack access to digital services despite infrastructure availability
- Existing AI chatbots inform citizens of eligibility but cannot complete applications
- Government portals feature hostile UX: aggressive timeouts, English/Sarkari Hindi, complex workflows
- VLEs spend 20 minutes per application due to repetitive form-filling
- Low throughput (3 applications/hour) forces VLEs to charge illicit fees

**The Root Cause:**
The "Read-Only Trap" - Government portals are effectively read-only for target demographics due to:
- Linguistic exclusion (Sanskritized administrative Hindi vs. regional dialects)
- Hostile UX patterns (session timeouts, non-responsive layouts)
- Cognitive overload (15-20 field mapping from physical documents)
- Traditional RPA brittleness (fixed selectors break when DOM changes)

**GramSetu's Solution:**
Transform "read-only" portals into "read-write" APIs through autonomous agents that:
- Navigate visually (immune to DOM changes)
- Understand vernacular voice commands
- Recover from failures intelligently
- Maintain human oversight for accountability

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

**Primary Goals:**
1. Enable **autonomous portal navigation** with VLE supervision for critical checkpoints
2. Achieve **10x VLE productivity** increase (3 apps/hour → 30 apps/hour)
3. Support **11+ Indian languages** through Bhashini integration with dialect mapping
4. Implement **privacy-by-design** with edge-based Aadhaar masking
5. Operate **offline-tolerant** with intelligent job queuing and sync
6. Provide **WhatsApp-based citizen notifications** for transparency
7. Maintain **DPDP Act 2023 compliance** with consent capture and audit trails
8. Support **20+ high-impact government schemes** at launch

**Performance Goals:**
- Voice-to-intent latency: < 3 seconds
- Application completion time: 2 minutes (vs. 20 minutes manual)
- Intent recognition accuracy: > 90%
- Aadhaar masking accuracy: 100%
- System uptime: 99.5%
- Offline sync success rate: > 90%

**Economic Goals:**
- VLE hourly revenue: ₹60 → ₹600 (10x increase)
- VLE monthly revenue: ₹12,000 → ₹1,20,000
- Transaction fee: ₹2 per successful application (10% of VLE earnings)
- Freemium model: First 100 transactions free

### 2.2 Non-Goals

1. **NOT** a direct citizen-facing app (VLEs remain essential intermediaries)
2. **NOT** bypassing security measures (CAPTCHA/OTP require VLE intervention)
3. **NOT** storing Aadhaar numbers permanently
4. **NOT** modifying government portal functionality
5. **NOT** 100% autonomous (human-in-the-loop for critical decisions)

## 10. Constraints and Assumptions

### 10.1 Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**
- GramSetu must operate within existing CSC infrastructure (no specialized hardware)
- The system cannot modify government portal code or bypass security (CAPTCHA/OTP)
- Bhashini API availability and performance limits multilingual capabilities
- Rural internet connectivity: intermittent 2G/3G with bandwidth < 1 Mbps
- Mobile devices: entry-level Android (4GB RAM, limited storage)

**Regulatory Constraints:**
- DPDP Act 2023 compliance mandatory (consent, minimization, localization)
- UIDAI regulations prohibit permanent Aadhaar storage
- CERT-In guidelines require incident reporting within 6 hours
- IT Act 2000 liability for data breaches

**Operational Constraints:**
- VLEs have varying technical literacy (interface must be intuitive)
- Budget limits initial scheme coverage to 20 high-priority schemes
- CSCs have basic IT support (system must be self-healing)
- Government portals change without notice (visual navigation mitigates)

### 10.2 Assumptions

**Infrastructure Assumptions:**
- VLEs have access to smartphones with camera and microphone
- CSCs have basic internet connectivity (even if intermittent)
- AWS infrastructure remains available and performant
- Bhashini services continue to improve and remain free/affordable

**User Assumptions:**
- Citizens provide informed consent for data processing
- VLEs receive 2-day training on GramSetu before deployment
- CSCs have basic troubleshooting capabilities (restart app, check network)
- VLEs are motivated by 10x income increase to adopt new system

**Regulatory Assumptions:**
- Government portals remain accessible (not blocked for automation)
- DPDP Act enforcement allows legitimate service delivery use cases
- Scheme eligibility rules are publicly documented and accessible
- Portal authentication mechanisms (OTP) remain human-verifiable

## 11. Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded)

1. **Direct citizen self-service app**: GramSetu serves VLEs, not citizens directly
2. **CAPTCHA/OTP bypass**: These require human intervention by design
3. **Payment processing**: Integration with payment gateways deferred to Phase 2
4. **Biometric authentication**: Aadhaar e-KYC integration deferred to Phase 2
5. **Voice biometrics**: "Voice as password" deferred to Q3 2024
6. **Offline voice recognition**: Requires cloud Bhashini APIs
7. **Support for all 700+ government schemes**: Phased rollout starting with top 20
8. **Multi-tenancy for non-CSC operators**: Initial focus on CSC ecosystem only
9. **Mobile app for tier-1 city citizens**: Product market fit is rural India
